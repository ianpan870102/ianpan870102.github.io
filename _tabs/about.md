Hi, I'm Ian Pan. Welcome to my personal website, where I mostly blog
about programming stuff and nerdy things I'm interested in.

I am a software engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS). I recently
graduated from Columbia University with a master's degree in Computer
Science. Last year, I did an internship at AWS, where I designed and a
scalable generic aggregator microservice for the AWS server
fleet. 

I previously graduated from CUHK with a BSc. in Computer Science (with
Honors) and a Minor in Finance. As my undergraduate thesis, I designed
novel multi-armed bandit greedy algorithms and proposed dynamic
pricing models. I am also a former machine learning research intern at
[Academia Sinica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia_Sinica), R3
Corda blockchain software engineer intern at [CryptoBLK
Limited](https://www.cryptoblk.io/home), programming instructor at
[First Code Academy](https://www.firstcodeacademy.com/), and EY
cybersecurity competition Asia-Pacific finalist team leader.
