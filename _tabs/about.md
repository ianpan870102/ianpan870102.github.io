Hi, I'm Ian Pan. Welcome to my personal website, where I mostly blog
about programming stuff and nerdy things I'm interested in.

I am a Computer Science Master's student at **Columbia
University**. I'm working at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** as a
software engineer intern this summer.  I previously graduated from
CUHK with a BSc. in Computer Science (with Honors) and a Minor in
Finance.

As my undergraduate thesis, I designed novel multi-armed bandit
greedy algorithms and proposed dynamic pricing models. I am also a
former machine learning research intern at [Academia
Sinica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia_Sinica), R3
Corda blockchain software
engineer intern at [CryptoBLK Limited](https://www.cryptoblk.io/home),
programming instructor at [First Code
Academy](https://www.firstcodeacademy.com/), and EY cybersecurity
competition Asia-Pacific finalist team leader.

see more of my working experiences and academic achievements.
