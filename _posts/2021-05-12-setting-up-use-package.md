[Use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) is a popular
package to organize your Emacs configuration and loading the packages
in a performance-boosting way. According to the official README,
use-package is a macro that allows you to isolate package
configuration in a way that's both performance-oriented and tidy.
