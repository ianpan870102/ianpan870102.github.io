Hi, I'm Ian Pan. Welcome to my personal website, where I mostly blog
about programming stuff and nerdy things I'm interested in.

I am a computer science master's student at
[Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University)
University. I recently graduated from
[CUHK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_University_of_Hong_Kong)
with a major in computer science and a minor in finance.

As my undergraduate thesis, I've developed novel multi-armed bandit
greedy algorithms and proposed dynamic pricing models. I am also a
former machine learning research intern at [Academia
Sinica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia_Sinica), R3
Corda blockchain software
engineer intern at [CryptoBLK Limited](https://www.cryptoblk.io/home),
programming instructor at [First Code
Academy](https://www.firstcodeacademy.com/), and EY cybersecurity
competition Asia-Pacific finalist team leader.

see more of my working experiences and academic achievements.
