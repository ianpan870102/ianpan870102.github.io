Hi, I'm Ian Pan. Welcome to my personal website, where I mostly blog
about programming stuff and nerdy things I'm interested in.

I am an incoming computer science master's student at [Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University) University, and
will soon graduate from
[CUHK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_University_of_Hong_Kong)
with a major in computer science and minor in finance.

I'm currently developing novel multi-armed bandit greedy algorithms
and researching dynamic pricing models. I am also a former machine
learning research intern at [Academia
Sinica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia_Sinica), R3 Corda
blockchain software engineer intern at CryptoBLK Limited, programming
instructor at First Code Academy, and EY cybersecurity competition
Asia-Pacific finalist team leader.

Visit [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianyepan/) to
see more of my working experiences and academic achievements.
