Hi, I'm Ian. Welcome to my personal website, where I mostly blog about
programming stuff and nerdy things I'm interested in.

I am an incoming computer science graduate student at Columbia
University, having recently graduated from CUHK with a bachelor's
degree in computer science.

I'm currently developing novel multi-armed bandit greedy algorithms
and researching dynamic pricing models. I am also a former machine
learning research intern at Academia Sinica, R3 Corda blockchain
software engineer intern at CryptoBLK Limited, programming instructor
at First Code Academy, and EY cybersecurity competition Asia-Pacific
finalist team leader.
