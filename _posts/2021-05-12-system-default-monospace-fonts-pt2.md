In my previous post, I talked about the practical reasons to use
monospace fonts and introduced four system default fonts: Consolas, SF
Mono, DejaVu Sans Mono, and Roboto Mono.

Here's to refresh the memory:

| Operating system | Default monospace font |
| -----------      | -----------            |
| Windows 10       | Consolas               |
| macOS            | SF Mono                |
| Linux            | DejaVu Sans Mono       |
| Android          | Roboto Mono            |


In addition to these four, I also mentioned Menlo and Monaco as
deprecated macOS fonts. In this blog post, I will give a subjective
comparison of these 6 typography designs.
