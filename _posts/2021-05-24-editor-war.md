I first heard of the names "Emacs" and "Vim" in the TV Show Silicon
Valley [when protagonist Richard was arguing with his new software
developer girlfriend about Tabs
vs. Spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI) (probably not
the best topic when you're trying to get laid).

If you don't know much about these two editors, this post might not
make much sense to you. If you're interested regardless, I suggest you
take a few minutes and read [this Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war) first. I will not
dive into the differences between these two editors, or compare their
advantages and disadvantages, as there are already hundreds of similar
blog posts and videos online. Instead, I will focus on my hands-on
experiences and subjective opinions about these tools.

## FAQ

#### FAQ1: Should I give up Visual Studio Code and use Emacs or Vim?

No, no one should ever tell you what you should use.

You don't have to give up Visual Studio Code, because there is nothing
wrong with it. Microsoft has done a brilliant job pushing this editor
forward, introducing a beautiful user interface now serving as
community standard, maintaining a plug-and-play Marketplace,
perfecting the integration with Windows Subsystem for Linux, and
inventing LSP (Language Server Protocol), which is now adopted by
almost every editor, including Emacs and Vim, through plugins and
packages.

#### FAQ2: What's with you Emacs/Vim users, what *"eXactLY iS sO goOd"* about them?

It's impossible to explain it in a few words, and I won't even bother
trying. What I will say is, once you grok it, it's like Christopher
Columbus discovering the Americas. You will chuckle at yourself for
not learning it sooner.

#### FAQ3: Is Emacs/Vim for everyone?

I wish it were, but it isn't. It takes a massive amount of time and
self-hypnotizing perseverance to get through the first few weeks of
psychological pain and counter-productivity. The few people I know
who've tried could not get over this phase.

## Which one should I use, Emacs or Vim?
