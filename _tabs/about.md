I am an incoming Master of Science Computer Science student at
Columbia University currently developing novel multi-armed bandit
greedy algorithms and researching dynamic pricing models. I am also a
former machine learning research intern at Academia Sinica, R3 Corda
blockchain software engineer intern at CryptoBLK Limited, programming
instructor at First Code Academy, and cybersecurity competition
Asia-Pacific finalist team leader.
